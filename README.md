# OCR-to-Excel-Automation
Instead of doing image-by-image OCR and copy-pasting it, this is an automation code from which OCR outputs of all images in a folder can automatically be exported into an excel file. 

## Description
In the previous Paddle tutorial, I had manually done OCR image-by-image, which was a very tedious task.
In this file, the images folder is directly uploaded into the program, and it writes the OCR result along with the image path into the excel file, which makes it very convenient.

## Note
I had tried to also send the OCR image to the excel file, but I was unable to find any way to do so. Therefore, I had to move on with the second best option. It's not a very fancy code, but automation always helps.

Here's a snapshot of the result.
